DTOS is the name that I have chosen for my post-installation script that will deploy my Xmonad config, my Vim config, as well as associated programs that are needed to create a proper "desktop" experience.  DTOS should work on Arch Linux or any Arch-based distribution.  The programs that will be installed include Xmonad, Xmobar, Vim, Fish and other programs needed to recreate DT's XMonad desktop.  DTOS is only for x86_64 architecture and will not work on ARM devices such as the Raspberry Pi.

* Installing DTOS
** Installation instructions
To install DTOS, you need to clone this repository and run the ~dtos~ script.
#+begin_example
git clone https://github.com/hmanhng/dtos.git
cd dtos/
./dtos
#+end_example

** Potential bugs
*** Slow download times.
This script can take a long time to complete since it will install more than 300 packages.  Also, make sure that the Linux distro that you are installing this on uses ParallelDownloads in /etc/pacman.conf for faster download times!  For an example, to enable ParallelDownloads so it downloads up to five packages at a time:

#+begin_example
ParallelDownloads = 5
#+end_example
*** Package conflicts that cause the script to fail
+ shell-color-scripts (from dtos-core-repo) conflicts with shell-color-scripts from the AUR.
+ dtos-opendoas (from dtos-core-repo) conflicts with opendoas from the Arch repos.

The solution is, before running the script, edit the pkglist.txt file and remove the packages above.
